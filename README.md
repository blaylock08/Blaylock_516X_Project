## Creator Introduction

<div align="center">  
Hello everyone! My name is Kyle Blaylock and I am a graduate student at Iowa State University. I am currently working on a Master's of Science degree in Agricultural Engineering with an emphasis in Advanced Machinery Systems. More specifically, self-propelled agricultural sprayers and how their performance can be improved. I took ABE 516X because my research is very data heavy and I wanted to learn new and different ways to handle large amounts of data.

## Getting The Data

Decsription of how the data was retrieved and classified.

## Exploring the Data

Might cut this one.

## Data Modeling and Machine Learning
  
Describe the methods used.

## Model Verificaiton and Accuracy

Describe the accuracy of each model type, benefits, downfalls, etc.

## User Input Section

Idea is to have a user input an image and then the website will classify it for them.
This might be a long shot on getting this to work but I'd like to give it a shot.
