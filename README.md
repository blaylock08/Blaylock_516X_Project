## Creator Introduction

Hello everyone! My name is Kyle Blaylock and I am a graduate student at Iowa State University. I am currently working on a Master's of Science degree in Agricultural Engineering with an emphasis in Advanced Machinery Systems. More specifically, self-propelled agricultural sprayers and how their performance can be improved. I took ABE 516X because my research is very data heavy and I wanted to learn new and different ways to handle large amounts of data.

## Project & Website Description
  
The goal of this website / project is to be able to take an uploaded image from the site user and classify it into one of the following animal groups:

  - *Mammals*
  - *Birds*
  - *Fish*
  - *Reptiles*
  - *Amphibians*
  
To accomplish this, several machine learning models will be trained with collected image data and evaluated based on their accuracy.
The most accurate model will be chosen and used to evaluate the user input image on this website.

## Data Collection

Data was collected by doing a Google Image search for each of the animal groups and then saving images of each group into a local folder. During collection I did my best to only include images that were of the animals in their natural habitat (e.g. no images with white or black baackgrounds, human hands in the picture etc.) These images were then referenced into an Excel spread sheet which classified which group that image belonged to.

## Data Modeling 
  
Describe the methods used to handle the data.

## Machine Learning

Describe the machine learning methods used.

## Model Verification & Accuracy

Describe the accuracy of each model type, benefits, downfalls, etc.

## User Input Section

Idea is to have a user input an image and then the website will classify it for them.
This might be a long shot on getting this to work but I'd like to give it a shot.
