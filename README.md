## Creator Introduction: Kyle Blaylock

Hello everyone! My name is Kyle Blaylock and I am a graduate student at Iowa State University. I am currently working on a Master's of Science degree in Agricultural Engineering with an emphasis in Advanced Machinery Systems. More specifically, self-propelled agricultural sprayers and how their performance can be improved. I took ABE 516X because my research is very data heavy and I wanted to learn new and different ways to handle large amounts of data.
