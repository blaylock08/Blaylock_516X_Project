Hello everyone! My name is Kyle Blaylock and I am a graduate student at Iowa State University. I am currently working on a Master's of Science degree in Agricultual and Biosystem's Engineering with am emphasis in Adavanced Machinery Systems. More specifically self-propelled agricultual sprayers and how we can improve their performance. I took ABE 516X because my research is very data heavy and I wanted to learn new and different ways to handle large amounts of data.
