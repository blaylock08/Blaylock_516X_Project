## Creator Introduction

<div align="center">  
Hello everyone! My name is Kyle Blaylock and I am a graduate student at Iowa State University. I am currently working on a Master's of Science degree in Agricultural Engineering with an emphasis in Advanced Machinery Systems. More specifically, self-propelled agricultural sprayers and how their performance can be improved. I took ABE 516X because my research is very data heavy and I wanted to learn new and different ways to handle large amounts of data.

## Project Abstract
  
The goal of this website / prject is to be able to take an uploaded image from the site user and classify it into one of the following animal groups:

  #### - *Mammals*
  #### - *Birds*
  #### - *Fish*
  #### - *Reptiles*
  #### - *Amphibians*
  
To accomplish this, several machine learning models will be trained with collected image data and evaluated based on their accuracy.
The most accurate model will be chosen and used to evaluate the user input image on this website.

## Getting The Data

Decsription of how the data was retrieved and classified.

## Exploring the Data

Might cut this one.

## Data Modeling and Machine Learning
  
Describe the methods used.

## Model Verificaiton and Accuracy

Describe the accuracy of each model type, benefits, downfalls, etc.

## User Input Section

Idea is to have a user input an image and then the website will classify it for them.
This might be a long shot on getting this to work but I'd like to give it a shot.
